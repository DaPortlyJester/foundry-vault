This allows you to keep magic armor invested and benefit from the power of any runes on the associated heavy armor, but no one else can wear your heavy armor without the padded undercoat.</p>"},"rules":[],"slug":"padded-armor","_migration":{"version":0.939,"lastMigration":null,"previous":null},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["comfort"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":0},"quantity":1,"baseItem":"padded-armor","bulk":{"value":0.1},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"price":{"value":{"sp":2}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"value":true,"inSlot":true,"handsHeld":0},"containerId":null,"size":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.fleshwarpSize}","material":{"type":null,"grade":null},"identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"","img":"","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"category":"light","group":null,"acBonus":1,"strength":0,"dexCap":3,"checkPenalty":0,"speedPenalty":0,"runes":{"potency":0,"resilient":0,"property":[]},"subitems":[]},"type":"armor","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.zBYEU9E7034ENCmh","duplicateSource":null,"exportSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.1.1","createdTime":1750216538600,"modifiedTime":1750216538766,"lastModifiedBy":"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"ovnjspwg5XGHSExB","img":"icons/equipment/shield/targe-wooden-boss-steel-brown.webp","name":"Caster's Targe","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>This small shield is made from wood.
