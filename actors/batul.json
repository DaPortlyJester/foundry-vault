While clearly strong and well-muscled, her physique is more lean and powerful than massively heavy, fitting for a shaman who has also endured life as a hermit. She weighs around <strong>220 pounds</strong>, with dense muscle developed through a life of resilience rather than pure brute force.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:229\">Batul is a striking figure, radiating an aura of primal power, deep sorrow, and unsettling intensity. Her orcish heritage is undeniable, yet it's overlaid with the unique weathering of her personal loss attuned to her connection with the spirits.</p><p><br />She possesses a powerful and athletic build. Her shoulders are broad, and her limbs display lean, ropelike musculature, hinting at both inherent orcish strength and the agility needed to survive the treacherous Mwangi jungles. She carries herself with a certain gravitas, though an underlying tension might be perceptible.</p><ul data-sourcepos=\"11:1-20:486\"><li data-sourcepos=\"12:1-12:733\"><strong>Skin &amp; Markings:</strong> Her skin is a deep, earthy olive green, almost greyish in certain lights, with a slightly rough texture. It's adorned with a multitude of ritualistic white markings and symbols, painted or tattooed across her face, shoulders, and arms. These appear to be a mix of older designs, perhaps faded remnants from her Dretha worship, and newer, possibly more erratic or deeply personal symbols reflecting her connection to the spirits, her devotion to Pharasma, or even the fractured state of her mind. One prominent, perhaps more jagged or faded, marking might be a relic of the N'ankha ritual. Scars from past conflicts and survival are likely visible beneath these markings, particularly on her arms and torso.</li><li data-sourcepos=\"13:1-14:515\"><p><strong>Face &amp; Features:</strong> Batul’s face is a compelling mask of strength and sorrow. Her jaw is strong and defined, leading to moderately sized, sharp lower tusks that jut proudly upwards. Her nose is broad and somewhat flat. Her brow is prominent, and her ears have a subtle point, adorned with multiple simple, perhaps bone or dark metal, hoop earrings.</p><ul data-sourcepos=\"14:5-14:515\"><li data-sourcepos=\"14:5-14:515\"><strong>Eyes:</strong> Her eyes are a piercing, luminous pale blue, almost glowing, which stand in stark contrast to her darker skin and hair. They are deeply set and carry an immense weight – a profound sadness from the loss of her first child, the burning intensity of a shaman who communes with spirits, and a disturbing, almost unnerving focus that hints at her sacrificed sanity. They might rarely blink, giving her an unwavering, and slightly unsettling, gaze. Dark circles or a haunted look might often shadow them.</li></ul></li><li data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:541\"><strong>Hair:</strong> Her hair is a cascade of thick, dark dreadlocks, perhaps a deep black or darkest brown, streaked with a few strands of premature grey that speak to her age and the immense stress she has endured. These dreadlocks are long, flowing well past her shoulders, and are interwoven with various shamanistic accoutrements: small animal bones (perhaps including tiny, delicate vertebrae or teeth), dark feathers (possibly crow or raven), and strips of aged leather or sinew. A few strands might be plaited with beads of bone or dark wood.</li><li data-sourcepos=\"16:1-19:204\"><p><strong>Attire &amp; Accessories:</strong> She is clad in practical yet ritualistically significant attire. A dark, roughly textured leather or hide top covers her torso, possibly sleeveless or with ragged cap sleeves, adorned with more bone pieces or stitched symbols. She wears a heavy, dark furred mantle or capelet around her shoulders, fastened with a significant bone or carved wooden toggle. Around her waist, a thick leather belt cinches a skirt or loincloth made of layered hides or coarse, dark fabric.</p><ul data-sourcepos=\"17:5-19:204\"><li data-sourcepos=\"17:5-17:274\">Numerous necklaces of varying lengths adorn her neck and chest, composed of bone beads, carved wooden fetishes, animal teeth, and perhaps a larger, more central piece that could be a crudely fashioned symbol of Pharasma (a dark, spiraling comet or a broken hourglass).</li><li data-sourcepos=\"18:5-18:81\">Her arms are adorned with multiple bracelets and wraps of leather and bone.</li><li data-sourcepos=\"19:5-19:204\">Her lizard familiar would likely be found nestled within her dreadlocks, perched on her furred mantle, or wrapped around one of her arms, its color perhaps complementing her attire or skin markings.</li></ul></li><li data-sourcepos=\"20:1-20:486\"><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> Batul is a visually arresting character. The interplay of her powerful orcish form, the intricate and somewhat wild shamanistic adornments, the haunting intensity of her pale eyes, and the subtle indicators of her fractured sanity create an image of a woman deeply connected to primal forces, burdened by immense loss, and teetering on the edge of something profound and perhaps dangerous. She is a survivor, a mother, a shaman, and a soul marked by sacrifice.</li></ul>","backstory":"<p>In the harsh and unforgiving lands of the orc holds, Batul’s early life was steeped in the fervent worship of Dretha, the Dark Mother. Dretha, the orc goddess of fertility, birth, and tribes, was a demanding deity, her tenets reflecting the brutal realities of orcish life—strength, survival, and the continuation of the tribe above all else. Batul, strong-willed and deeply connected to the primal spirits of the world, rose as an animist shaman, her guttural chants and bone-rattling drumming calling forth the blessings of the Dark Mother for her people. She carried a small, scuttling lizard, a familiar tethered to her spirit, its flickering tongue a conduit to the whispers of the unseen world.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:842\">The Nine Walls Orc holds, a cluster of fortified settlements clinging to the rugged mountains, was a place of constant strife and brutal tradition. It was here that Batul experienced the profound joy of motherhood for the first time, a fierce, protective love blooming in her heart. But Dretha's ways were often cruel. As was custom among certain zealous followers, Batul's firstborn was chosen for a N'ankha ritual – a sacred, yet terrifying, rite intended to appease the Dark Mother and ensure the prosperity of the hold. The ritual, shrouded in ancient tradition and whispered dread, involved the offering of the 'most precious' to Dretha, a sacrifice to fuel the tribe's vitality and secure her favor in future births and battles. For Batul, this meant the unbearable loss of her child, given over to the unfathomable will of her goddess.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:788\">The N'ankha ritual shattered Batul. The joyous mother was replaced by a hollow echo, her faith in Dretha curdling into a bitter poison. The Dark Mother, who was meant to protect and nurture new life, had demanded the ultimate price, and for Batul, it was a price too steep, a betrayal too deep. In her grief and rage, she turned her back on Dretha and the blood-soaked traditions of her hold. Her spirit, once a blazing fire of devotion, now sought solace in a different, more impartial power: Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, the stern judge of souls, the goddess of birth, death, and fate. Pharasma offered not comfort, but a cold, undeniable order to the chaos of existence, a stark contrast to Dretha's passionate and often destructive whims. For Batul, this impartiality was a lifeline.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:908\">Driven by her anguish and the need to escape the suffocating traditions that had cost her so dearly, Batul abandoned the Nine Walls. She journeyed far, seeking a place where the shadows of her past might not reach, eventually finding a semblance of solitude in the dense, humid jungles surrounding Lake Ocota in the Mwangi Expanse. This vast, inland sea, teeming with life and ancient secrets, offered a refuge. Here, Batul lived as a hermit, her only companions the rustling leaves, the calls of unseen creatures, and her faithful lizard familiar. She honed her connection to the spirits of the wild, her shamanistic powers taking on a new, rawer edge, colored by her sorrow and burgeoning understanding of the cycle of life and death as overseen by Pharasma. The orc tribes native to the Lake Ocota region were wary of outsiders, but Batul’s solitary existence and evident spiritual power kept most at bay.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:574\">Yet, even in the depths of the jungle, the outside world intruded. A halfling assassin named Ceufroy, dispatched by shadowy figures from her past or perhaps rivals within the Nine Walls who saw her defection as a threat, found his way to her isolated dwelling. He came to end her life, but Batul, hardened by loss and empowered by the primal forces of the jungle, was no easy prey. In a desperate confrontation, she managed to overpower the skilled killer. Instead of slaying him, a darker thought, a seed of the lingering trauma and a desperate need for control, took root.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:433\">Drawing upon her deep connection to the spirits and a wellspring of pain, Batul wove a potent curse, binding Ceufroy to her service. The magic was powerful, but it came at a terrible cost. To fuel such a binding, to twist another’s will so completely, Batul willingly sacrificed a fragment of her own sanity. The edges of her perception began to fray, whispers of paranoia and delusion seeping into her thoughts like the jungle mist.</p><p data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:839\">Life in their strange, forced cohabitation took an unexpected turn. Proximity, shared survival in the harsh jungle, and perhaps the very magic that bound them, fostered a complex, twisted relationship. From this unlikely and cursed union, another child was born. The joy of this new life was a fragile thing, constantly threatened by Batul’s deteriorating mental state. The curse on Ceufroy, a constant drain on her spirit, continued to unravel her mind. She loved her new child with a fierce, almost desperate intensity, yet the shadows in her own soul grew longer, her grip on reality loosening with each passing season in the vibrant, dangerous jungles around Lake Ocota. Her lizard familiar remained, a silent, watchful presence, perhaps the last anchor to the shaman she once was, and a witness to the fractured soul she was becoming.</p>","birthPlace":"The Nine Walls","attitude":"","beliefs":"","anathema":[],"edicts":[],"likes":"","dislikes":"","catchphrases":"","campaignNotes":"","allies":"","enemies":"","organizations":"","visibility":{"appearance":true,"backstory":false,"personality":false,"campaign":false}},"keyability":{"value":"wis"},"xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1000,"pct":0},"age":{"value":"37"},"height":{"value":"6'2\""},"weight":{"value":"220"},"gender":{"value":"Female"},"ethnicity":{"value":"Matanji"},"nationality":{"value":"Nine Walls"},"deity":{"value":"Pharasma"},"alliance":null},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"value":1,"max":3},"focus":{"max":1,"value":1},"mythicPoints":{"value":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.939,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"13.344","system":"7.1.1"}},"abilities":null,"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":1},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":2},"nature":{"rank":3},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":3},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"pfs":{"playerNumber":null,"characterNumber":null,"levelBump":false,"currentFaction":"EA","school":null,"reputation":{"EA":null,"GA":null,"HH":null,"VS":null,"RO":null,"VW":null}},"exploration":[],"traits":{"size":{"value":"med"},"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"build":{"attributes":{"boosts":{"1":["wis","con","str","int"],"5":["wis","con","dex","cha"],"10":["wis","str","cha","dex"]}}},"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":2},"martial":{"advanced":{"rank":0},"heavy":{"rank":0},"light":{"rank":2},"medium":{"rank":2},"unarmored":{"rank":2},"martial":{"rank":0},"simple":{"rank":2},"unarmed":{"rank":2}},"crafting":{"formulas":[]}},"_id":"9O9foDXSIXsvYgFi","img":"tokenizer/pc-images/batul.Avatar.webp?1746580884871","items":[{"_id":"EgtrnQjlTeWYPrPw","folder":"mxeDA21feNRRstOp","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/deities/pharasma.webp","name":"Pharasma","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Before there was time, or even a sun or moon by which to measure it, there was a beginning.

As an animist, your incantations might take the form of reciting relevant snippets of legends—stories passed down orally—or they might see you calling nearby spirits to honor ancient vows. Your gestures could be elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies inherited from your spiritual allies surge through you.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>The clearly delineated partnership between an animist and their apparitions means you can't cast your animist spells using your apparition spell slots or vice versa—your magics remain complementary and harmonious, yet as distinct as the two worlds from which they come.</p><h3>Animist Spellcasting</h3><p>As a keeper of knowledge, you are constantly learning new techniques and spells. Each day, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and 2 cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells you've gained access to and learned via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an animist, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Animist Spells Per Day.</p>\n<p>You are a prepared spellcaster for the purposes of determining how you interact with staves and other items or effects that differentiate between prepared and spontaneous spellcasters.</p><h3>Apparition Spellcasting</h3><p>You can draw upon your attuned apparitions as a second source of magical knowledge and power. You gain additional spontaneous spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast two apparition cantrips and one 1st-rank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all your attuned apparitions. You can cast any spell in your apparition spell repertoire by using an apparition spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you cast them this way.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level, you gain further apparition spell slots, and your apparitions grant you higher-rank apparition spells, as detailed in each apparition entry.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. All your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten any apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of animist spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level animist, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level animist, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Vessel Spells</h3><p>Your primary attuned apparition can use your body as a conduit, allowing you to cast a unique vessel spell. Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. Because vessel spells are a manifestation of a specific apparition, an animist can't cast or Sustain a specific vessel spell in the same round they have already cast or Sustained it (for example, an animist who has cast earth's bile during their turn can't then cast or Sustain another instance of earth's bile during that same turn).</p>\n<p>It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to treat with nearby spirits, meditate on resolving an issue pertaining to the balance of spirits and mortals, or tell a story.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, though certain feats or abilities adjust this number, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>","gm":""},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder War of Immortals","authors":""},"rules":[],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["animist"],"otherTags":[]},"slug":"animist-apparition-spellcasting","_migration":{"version":0.939,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"13.344","system":"7.1.1"}},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"subfeatures":{"proficiencies":{},"senses":{},"suppressedFeatures":[]},"location":"xantxy4vSEYBxHi9"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.h825m7hd9qDO3369","duplicateSource":null,"exportSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.342","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.0.5-beta","createdTime":1746585727427,"modifiedTime":1746585727427,"lastModifiedBy":"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"ynj8XJsjNq8PbmYd","img":"icons/environment/settlement/blacksmith.webp","name":"Caretaker's Calling","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"calling","description":{"value":"<p>You have a deep-seated drive or divine directive to care for others, and your power might one day grow to allow you to heal an unimaginable wound.
