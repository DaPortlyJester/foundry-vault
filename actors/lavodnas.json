At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-rank spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest rank of spell slots. Any time you lose a rank of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. If it's a rank at which you lose a set of lower-rank slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a rank you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest rank of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-rank spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd rank.</p>","gm":""},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":""},"rules":[{"itemId":"{item|id}","key":"ItemAlteration","mode":"override","property":"description","value":[{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartOne"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartTwo"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartThree"},{"divider":true,"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.SpellSwapping"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.SpellSwapping"}]},{"itemId":"{item|id}","key":"ItemAlteration","mode":"add","property":"traits","value":"{actor|class.slug}"}],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["bard","oracle","psychic","sorcerer","summoner"],"otherTags":[]},"slug":"spell-repertoire","_migration":{"version":0.939,"previous":null},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"subfeatures":{"proficiencies":{},"senses":{},"suppressedFeatures":[]},"location":"mvgsnB8jo45KEAou"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.1RfnAiyQ5FR7vnuH","duplicateSource":null,"exportSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.1.1","createdTime":1749785320831,"modifiedTime":1749785320831,"lastModifiedBy":"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"m7i0gchfKyEfSJAY","img":"icons/tools/instruments/pipe-flue-tan.webp","name":"Composition Spells","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions.

You gain a single arcane or occult cantrip of your choice, heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level, rounded up. If you weren't already, you become trained in that tradition's spell DCs and spell attack rolls, with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability if you choose arcane or Charisma as your spellcasting ability if you choose occult. Regardless of your choice, you also either become trained in Arcana or Occultism, or an expert in one of these skills if you are already trained in both.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.sY25SoDaHBPIG5Jw]{Nantambu Chime-Ringer}</p>","gm":""},"level":{"value":2,"taken":10},"prerequisites":{"value":[{"value":"trained in Performance"},{"value":"trained in Society"}]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder #170: Spoken on the Song Wind","authors":""},"rules":[],"subfeatures":{"proficiencies":{"spellcasting":{"rank":1,"attribute":null}},"senses":{},"suppressedFeatures":[]},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","value":["archetype","dedication"],"otherTags":[]},"slug":"nantambu-chime-ringer-dedication","_migration":{"version":0.939,"previous":null},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"location":"archetype-10"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.57K9il2Jxs8PmsYL","duplicateSource":null,"exportSource":null,"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.1.1","createdTime":1749785671891,"modifiedTime":1749785671891,"lastModifiedBy":"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4"},"effects":[],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"9NgANDWq4CU8NQr4":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"EDz7IRE1ETUOHulT","folder":"pCqf1zzdYxJ29gRS","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-exclamation.webp","name":"Helt's Spelldance","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"class","description":{"value":"<p>Ranik Helt knows a special technique to hide his spells as part of a performance, and you've learned this technique.
